**Bonus table:**

| empId | bonus |
|--------|--------|
| 2      | 500   |
| 4      | 2000  |

## ‚úÖ Example Output

| name  | bonus |
|--------|--------|
| John   | null   |
| Dan    | 500   |
| Brad   | null   |

---

## üí° Explanation

- Employee with **empId = 2** (Dan) has a bonus of 500 which is **< 1000**, so included.  
- Employee with **empId = 4** (Thomas) has a bonus of 2000 which is **‚â• 1000**, so **excluded**.  
- Employees with no bonus record (empId = 1 ‚Üí John; empId = 3 ‚Üí Brad) have `NULL` bonus ‚Üí included.  
- So the output lists ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù, ‚ÄúDan‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBrad‚Äù with their respective bonus (NULL or actual value).
